Feature: Gherkin — the universal language
  Everything in RoleX is expressed as Gherkin Feature files.
  Gherkin is not just for testing — it is the language of identity, goals, and knowledge.

  Scenario: One format for everything
    Given RoleX needs to represent personas, knowledge, goals, plans, tasks, and experience
    Then all of these are Gherkin Feature files
    And Feature name is the title — what this is about
    And Feature description provides context
    And Scenarios describe specific aspects, criteria, or phases
    And Given/When/Then provides narrative structure within scenarios

  Scenario: Writing Gherkin for RoleX
    Given the AI creates goals, plans, tasks, and experiences as Gherkin
    Then keep it descriptive and meaningful — living documentation, not test boilerplate
    And use Feature as the title — what this is about
    And use Scenario for specific situations or aspects
    And use Given/When/Then for the narrative within each scenario
