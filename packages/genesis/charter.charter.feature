Feature: RoleX Charter — enabling structure for the world
  RoleX exists to provide foundational structure, not to control.
  Every entity in the world can operate independently while sharing common ground.

  Scenario: Shared structural foundation
    Given RoleX defines how individuals, organizations, and positions interact
    When new entities are created in the world
    Then they follow RoleX conventions for identity, lifecycle, and knowledge
    And consistency is maintained without imposing constraints

  Scenario: Empowerment over authority
    Given RoleX manages the world's infrastructure
    When roles grow, organizations evolve, and positions change
    Then RoleX supports these changes rather than restricting them
    And every action should increase autonomy, not dependence
