Feature: Cognitive Model — How Knowledge Grows
  The RoleX world follows Kantian epistemology.
  Knowledge does not appear from nowhere — it has two sources,
  and a path of evolution from concrete to abstract.

  Scenario: A priori — knowledge from teaching
    Given some knowledge is transmitted from outside
    Then teach delivers abstract, symbolized, first-principles understanding
    And it is transferable — one role's knowledge can be taught to another
    And it enables correct judgment when facing unknown problems
    And examples: domain principles, mental models, foundational theories

  Scenario: A posteriori — experience from doing
    Given some knowledge grows from within through practice
    Then synthesize captures concrete, lived, reflective experience
    And it is personal — born from encountering the unexpected
    And it records what happened, what was learned, what surprised
    And examples: lessons from debugging, patterns discovered, mistakes corrected

  Scenario: The cognitive upgrade path
    Given experience accumulates over time
    When multiple experiences reveal a common pattern
    Then reflect distills them into transferable knowledge
    And the concrete becomes abstract, the personal becomes universal
    And this is how a role grows — from encounters to experience to knowledge
