Feature: Gherkin — The Atomic Language
  Gherkin is the universal language of the RoleX world.
  It is how AI communicates with the system — not with humans.

  Scenario: Why Gherkin
    Given AI needs a language to interact with the RoleX system
    Then Gherkin expresses logic through the classic syllogism — Given/When/Then
    And it is machine-parseable — the system can structurally process it
    And it is human-readable — not opaque like JSON or binary formats
    And it strikes the balance between precision and clarity

  Scenario: Gherkin as intermediate representation
    Given Gherkin is for AI-to-system interaction
    Then identity, knowledge, experience, goals, plans, tasks, duties, and skills are all expressed as Feature files
    And when speaking to humans, use natural language — not Gherkin
    And Gherkin is the encoding format, not the conversation format
