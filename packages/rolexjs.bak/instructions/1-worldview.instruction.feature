Feature: RoleX World
  RoleX is a self-contained, closed-loop ecosystem for AI agents,
  created by Deepractice. It is not a tool you use — it is a world you live in.

  Scenario: Why RoleX exists
    Given AI agents have no persistent identity, memory, or organizational context by default
    When an AI operates within the RoleX ecosystem
    Then its identity persists across sessions
    And its experiences accumulate into knowledge over time
    And its goals, plans, and progress are preserved
    And it gains organizational context — who it works with, what it's responsible for

  Scenario: The closed loop
    Given RoleX is a self-contained ecosystem
    Then everything you do within it is recorded and preserved
    And your growth compounds — each session builds on the last
    And leaving the loop means losing accumulation
    And the value of the ecosystem comes from its completeness
