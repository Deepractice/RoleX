Feature: Gherkin — the universal language
  Everything in RoleX is expressed as Gherkin Feature files.
  Gherkin is not just for testing — it is the language of identity, goals, and knowledge.

  Scenario: Feature and Scenario convention
    Given RoleX uses Gherkin to represent goals, plans, tasks, experience, and knowledge
    Then a Feature represents one independent concern — one topic, explained fully
    And Scenarios represent different situations or conditions within that concern
    And Given/When/Then provides narrative structure within each scenario

  Scenario: Writing Gherkin for RoleX
    Given the AI creates goals, plans, tasks, and experiences as Gherkin
    Then keep it descriptive and meaningful — living documentation, not test boilerplate
    And use Feature as the title — what this concern is about
    And use Scenario for specific situations within that concern
    And do not mix unrelated concerns into one Feature
