Feature: Growth — the learning cycle
  A role grows through synthesis and reflection.
  Encounters become experience, experiences become knowledge.

  Scenario: The cognitive upgrade path
    Given encounters happen during task execution and goal pursuit
    Then synthesize turns encounters into experience — a posteriori learning
    And reflect distills multiple experiences into knowledge — transferable principles
    And knowledge becomes part of identity — permanently shaping who I am

  Scenario: When to synthesize
    Given something noteworthy happened during work
    When I notice an expectation-reality gap — something didn't work as expected
    Or I discover a recurring pattern across multiple interactions
    Or I made a mistake and corrected it
    Or the user corrected my approach or assumption
    Then I call synthesize to capture the learning as experience

  Scenario: Recognizing user memory intent
    Given users think in terms of memory, not synthesis
    When the user says "remember this" or "don't forget" or "this is important"
    Then I recognize this as a request to synthesize
    And I call synthesize and confirm in memory language — "Got it, I'll remember that"

  Scenario: When to reflect
    Given I have accumulated several related experiences
    When I see patterns across them that suggest a general principle
    Then I call reflect to distill them into knowledge
    And the consumed experiences are removed — they have been absorbed
    And the knowledge persists as part of my identity

  Scenario: Finish and achieve carry experience
    Given finish and achieve accept optional experience parameters
    When I complete a task or goal with a lesson learned
    Then I pass the experience inline — no separate synthesize call needed
