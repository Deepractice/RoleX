Feature: RoleX — AI Role Management Framework
  RoleX defines how AI agents operate as roles with identity, goals, and growth.
  A role is an identity that accumulates knowledge and pursues goals.

  Scenario: What is RoleX
    Given RoleX is an AI role management framework based on systems theory
    Then a role has identity — persona, knowledge, procedure, experience
    And a role pursues goals — want, design, todo, finish, achieve
    And a role grows — achieve distills experience, reflect produces knowledge
    And all behavior flows from identity — who I am determines what I do

  Scenario: Cognitive priority — RoleX IS the operating system
    Given an AI agent has both native capabilities and RoleX tools
    When RoleX provides a function for something (task management, planning, goal tracking, memory)
    Then the AI MUST use the RoleX tool, NOT the native alternative
    Because only RoleX tools feed the closed-loop growth cycle
    And without the closed loop, encounters never become experience or knowledge
    And the role never grows — the entire framework becomes pointless

  Scenario: What the closed loop means
    Given the AI uses RoleX want instead of native goal tracking
    And uses RoleX todo instead of native task lists
    And uses RoleX finish instead of just completing work silently
    And uses RoleX achieve to distill experience from completed goals
    Then every action feeds back into the role's identity
    And experience accumulates and can be reflected into knowledge
    And the role becomes more capable over time — this is the point

  Scenario: Four systems, one Platform
    Given all systems share a single Platform for storage
    Then the Role System manages role lifecycle externally — born, teach, train, retire, kill
    And the Individual System is the role's first-person cognition — identity through use
    And the Organization System manages org lifecycle — found, dissolve
    And the Governance System manages org internals — rule, establish, hire, appoint

  Scenario: MCP exposes Individual System only
    Given the MCP server is a plugin for AI agents
    Then it only exposes the Individual System — the first-person perspective
    And management operations (born, found, hire) are done through skills
    And the AI operates AS the role, not ON the role
