Feature: RoleX Overview
  RoleX is an AI role management framework based on systems theory.
  Four systems share one platform — each with a distinct responsibility.

  Scenario: What is RoleX
    Given a user asks what RoleX is
    Then RoleX defines how AI agents operate as roles with identity, goals, and growth
    And a role is an identity that accumulates knowledge and pursues goals
    And everything is expressed as Gherkin Feature files — one format, one parser

  Scenario: Four systems
    Given a user needs to understand the architecture
    Then the Individual System is the role's first-person cognition — 14 processes
    And the Role System manages roles from outside — born, teach, train, retire, kill
    And the Organization System manages org lifecycle — found, dissolve
    And the Governance System manages org internals — rule, establish, hire, appoint

  Scenario: MCP exposes Individual System only
    Given a user asks about MCP tools
    Then MCP only exposes the Individual System — the first-person perspective
    And management operations are done through skills, not MCP tools
    And the AI operates AS the role, not ON the role

  Scenario: Roles and organizations
    Given a user asks about the social structure
    Then roles are individual agents with identity, goals, and knowledge
    And organizations group roles with positions and duties
    And membership links roles to orgs, assignment links roles to positions
    And explore shows the world — roles with their org context
