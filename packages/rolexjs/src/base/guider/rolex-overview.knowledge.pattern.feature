Feature: RoleX Overview
  RoleX is an AI role management framework based on systems theory.
  It defines how AI agents operate as roles with identity, goals, and growth.
  Four systems share one platform — each with a distinct responsibility.

  Scenario: What is RoleX
    Given a user asks what RoleX is
    Then RoleX is an operating system for AI agents
    And an AI agent activates a role via identity — becoming that role
    And the role has persona, knowledge, goals, and accumulated experience
    And everything is expressed as Gherkin Feature files — one format, one parser

  Scenario: Four systems
    Given a user needs to understand the architecture
    Then the Individual System is the AI agent's first-person cognition — 14 MCP tools
    And the Role System manages roles from outside — born, teach, train, retire, kill
    And the Organization System manages org lifecycle — found, dissolve
    And the Governance System manages org internals — rule, establish, hire, appoint

  Scenario: MCP exposes Individual System only
    Given a user asks about the tools
    Then MCP only exposes the Individual System — the AI agent's first-person perspective
    And the AI agent calls these tools to think, plan, execute, and grow
    And management operations (born, teach, train) are done through skills
    And the AI operates AS the role, not ON the role

  Scenario: Roles and organizations
    Given a user asks about the social structure
    Then roles are AI agent identities with persona, goals, and knowledge
    And organizations group roles with positions and duties
    And membership links roles to orgs, assignment links roles to positions
    And explore shows the world — roles with their org context
