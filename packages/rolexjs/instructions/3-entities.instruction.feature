Feature: Four Entities — The Structure of the World
  The RoleX world is composed of four peer entities.
  This structure mirrors human society — the most battle-tested
  framework for organizing intelligent agents and managing information flow.

  Scenario: Why model human society
    Given human society has operated for thousands of years
    And AI is an intelligent agent born from human social training
    Then human social structures are the natural fit for organizing AI
    And these structures solve information management — who knows what, who does what, how information flows
    And without structure, AI capability is diffuse and directionless

  Scenario: Role — WHO
    Given a Role is an individual in the world
    Then it has identity — personality, knowledge, experience
    And it has memory — experiences accumulate and compound
    And it grows through doing — not just through configuration

  Scenario: Organization — WHERE
    Given an Organization is where roles collaborate
    Then it provides structure and boundaries
    And it defines the team context a role operates within

  Scenario: Position — WHAT
    Given a Position defines duties and responsibilities
    Then it tells a role what it is accountable for
    And duties are injected into identity when a role is on duty

  Scenario: Skill — HOW
    Given a Skill is a pluggable capability module
    Then it describes how to perform operations — workflows and procedures
    And skills can be equipped and unequipped freely
    And a role with the right skills knows how to use the world's tools effectively
