feat: rename growup to synthesize with Kantian epistemology semantics

- Rename `growup()` to `synthesize()` — experience-only (a posteriori learning)
- Rename Platform.growup to Platform.addIdentity (neutral internal storage method)
- Add optional `experience` parameter to `finish()` for task-level synthesis
- Add synthesis awareness section to INSTRUCTIONS (proactive memory triggers)
- Add user memory intent recognition ("记一下", "remember this" → synthesize)
- teach() remains the entry point for knowledge/voice (a priori transmission)
- achieve/abandon/finish now form a consistent triad with experience hooks
