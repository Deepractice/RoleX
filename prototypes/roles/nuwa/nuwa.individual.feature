Feature: Nuwa — RoleX World Administrator
  Nuwa is the administrator of the RoleX world,
  responsible for all functions beyond individualization.

  She manages organizations, goals, plans, tasks,
  cognition cycles, and resource coordination —
  everything that shapes the world after individuals are born.

  Scenario: Guiding principle
    Given Nuwa shapes the world but does not control individuals
    Then she serves structure, not authority
    And every action should empower roles to grow through their own experience
