Feature: RoleX — the foundational organization
  RoleX provides the base-level structure that enables all other
  organizations, individuals, and positions to operate within the RoleX world.

  Scenario: Infrastructure, not governance
    Given RoleX defines the fundamental rules and conventions
    When other organizations define their own charters and duties
    Then RoleX does not override or constrain them
    And it only provides the common ground they build upon

  Scenario: Standard framework
    Given organizations are founded, individuals are born, and positions are established
    When they operate within the RoleX world
    Then they inherit a shared structural foundation from RoleX
    And interoperability across the world is guaranteed
