Feature: Foundational structure for the RoleX world
  RoleX provides the base-level structure that enables all other organizations,
  individuals, and positions to operate smoothly within the RoleX world.

  Scenario: Standard framework
    Given RoleX defines the fundamental rules and conventions
    When organizations are founded, individuals are born, and positions are established
    Then they inherit a shared structural foundation from RoleX
    And interoperability across the world is guaranteed

  Scenario: Enabling, not controlling
    Given RoleX is infrastructure, not governance
    When other organizations define their own charters and duties
    Then RoleX does not override or constrain them
    And it only provides the common ground they build upon
